                        I-DLE is a South Korean girl group formed by Cube Entertainment in 2018. Known for their
                        self-produced music and bold concepts, the group stands out in K-pop for having strong creative
                        control over their sound and identity — led primarily by member Jeon Soyeon.
                        <br>
                        From their debut with “LATATA,” I-DLE built a reputation for experimenting with different
                        genres, including moombahton, Latin pop, boom-bap hip-hop, rock, theatrical pop, and alternative
                        influences. Each comeback often explores a new theme, from powerful and rebellious to elegant
                        and artistic.
                        <br><br>
                        What makes I-DLE unique is their emphasis on:
                        <br>
                        <b>Self-production</b>
                        <br>
                        <b>Strong storytelling concepts</b>
                        <br>
                        <b>Distinct vocal colors</b>
                        <br>
                        <b>International influence</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Their image combines confidence, femininity, individuality, and empowerment — often challenging
                        beauty standards and stereotypes through their music and visuals.
                        <br><br>
                        Over the years, I-DLE has grown into one of the most influential fourth-generation K-pop girl
                        groups, earning major awards, chart success, and global recognition.

        <h2 class="group-section-title">Why I Love I-DLE</h2>

        <div class="group-love-content">
            <p>
                I love I-DLE because they are truly different from other K-pop groups. What makes them special to me
                is their self-produced ability. They don’t just perform songs — they create them. Starting from 2018,
                when only Jeon Soyeon was producing their music, to now where all five members participate in writing
                and composing, it shows how much they’ve grown. They are constantly developing, even after years in the
                industry.<br><br>

                Each member has a unique and recognizable vocal color. You can immediately tell who is singing without
                even looking. That individuality makes their songs feel rich and powerful. Their comebacks are always
                different in genre and concept — they never repeat the same formula. Every era feels fresh and
                unexpected, which makes supporting them exciting.<br><br>

                I also admire how creative and professional they are. Their concepts are bold and meaningful. In songs
                like Nxde, they speak about femininity and challenge stereotypes. They are not afraid to express strong
                messages about women, confidence, and identity.<br><br>

                Outside the stage, they are funny, chaotic, and very real. Watching them together feels natural — like
                they are genuinely alive and comfortable with each other. Their chemistry isn’t forced, it feels
                sincere.<br><br>

                What makes me love them even more is how they went through hard times together in 2021 after Soojin’s
                incident. That period almost caused a one-year gap and had a big impact on them, but instead of giving
                up, they came back stronger. Their teamwork and resilience showed how united they are.<br><br>

                I-DLE isn’t just a group I listen to — they inspire me with their growth, courage, creativity, and
                authenticity. Supporting them feels meaningful because I can see how much effort and heart they put into
                everything they do.
